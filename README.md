This is a beginner mini-project using only HTML and CSS to construct an New Login web page. <br>
The goal is to practice placing, styling and aligning elements on a page. There's no Javascript and the links go nowhere, as this project does not aim to rebuild a fully working website, only the look and feel of a login page as best as I can.
